This project was made for the Analysis of algorithms course at Willamette University. 
It generates a random sequence of DNA with nitrogen bases represented by ascii characters.*

A = Adenine
T = Thymine
G = Guanine
C = Cytosine

*note that the chosen bases are completely random and will make a sequence of codons or proteins which will probably not be applicable in actual DNA

The purpose of the assignment is an analysis and implimentation of the longest common subsecuence algorithm
The dynamic itterative implimentation is obviously much faster than the brute force implimentation.
